# Directory Overview

This directory contains a collection of personal learning materials and resources focused on mastering Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) from the perspective of a C++ programmer. The documents provide a structured learning path, quick-reference code examples, and in-depth explanations of core UE4 concepts. The content is available in both English and Chinese.

# Key Files

*   `UE4_Learning_Plan.md` & `UE4_Learning_Plan_ZH.md`:
    *   A comprehensive learning guide structured around the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. It's designed for experienced C++ developers transitioning to the UE4 framework.
    *   It covers foundational topics such as the `UObject` system, memory management, the Actor-Component model, and the Gameplay Framework.
    *   Includes a practical project plan for a simple third-person action game to apply the learned concepts.

*   `UE4_Learning_Resources.md` & `UE4_Learning_Resources_ZH.md`:
    *   A concise cheat-sheet with essential C++ code snippets for common UE4 patterns.
    *   Provides quick examples for creating basic `UObject`s and `AActor`s, and using engine-specific data structures like `TArray`, `TMap`, and `Delegates`.

*   `Actors_And_Components_Visualized.md` & `Actors_And_Components_Visualized_ZH.md`:
    *   A detailed technical document explaining the fundamental Actor-Component architecture in Unreal Engine.
    *   Uses code examples and Mermaid diagrams to visually illustrate class relationships, component hierarchies, and runtime interactions like spawning actors and retrieving components.

# Usage

This directory is intended for self-directed study and reference.

1.  **Start with the Plan:** Use `UE4_Learning_Plan.md` as a roadmap to guide your learning journey from foundational concepts to practical application.
2.  **Quick Reference:** Keep `UE4_Learning_Resources.md` handy for quick access to common C++ code patterns in UE4.
3.  **Deep Dive:** Refer to `Actors_And_Components_Visualized.md` for a more thorough understanding of how to structure gameplay elements using Unreal's core architectural patterns.

# Guiding Principles

*   **Bloom's Revised Taxonomy**: When discussing topics, aim to ask questions that span different cognitive levels of Bloom's Revised Taxonomy (Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating) to foster deeper understanding and critical thinking.
