## Guiding Principles

This learning journey is structured with a few key ideas in mind:

*   **Structured Learning:** The content is organized around the **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)** cycle to provide a clear, actionable path from foundational concepts to practical application.
*   **Visualization:** Complex topics like the Actor-Component model or the Build System are explained using **Mermaid diagrams** to provide clear, visual illustrations of architectures and relationships.
*   **Deep Understanding:** The materials aim to foster critical thinking by touching on different cognitive levels of **Bloom's Revised Taxonomy**, encouraging not just remembering but also applying, analyzing, and creating.

## Key Files Overview

This repository is organized into several key documents designed to serve different learning needs:

*   ["UE4_Learning_Plan.md"](./Learning_Plan/UE4_Learning_Plan.md): The central roadmap and starting point. It outlines a comprehensive learning guide for experienced C++ developers transitioning to UE4.
*   ["UE4_Learning_Resources.md"](./Learning_Plan/UE4_Learning_Resources.md): A concise cheat-sheet with essential C++ code snippets for common UE4 patterns, perfect for quick reference.
*   [`Actors_And_Components_Visualized.md`](./Core_Concepts/Actors_And_Components_Visualized.md): A detailed technical document explaining the fundamental Actor-Component architecture using code examples and diagrams.
*   **The `..._Visualized.md` Series**: Each of these files provides a deep dive into a specific, core UE4 concept (e.g., `Build_System_Visualized.md`, `Smart_Pointers_Visualized.md`, `Gameplay_Ability_System_Visualized.md`).
*   ["UE4_Self_Check_Problems.md"](./Learning_Plan/UE4_Self_Check_Problems.md): A set of problems to test your understanding of the concepts, with answers provided in a separate file.
*   [`UE_Project/`](./UE_Project/): A companion Unreal Engine C++ project designed to demonstrate and apply the concepts learned throughout this guide.

## Recommended Usage

To get the most out of this repository, it is recommended to follow these steps:

1.  **Start with the Plan:** Use `UE4_Learning_Plan.md` as a roadmap to guide your learning journey from foundational concepts to practical application.
2.  **Deep Dive with Visual Guides:** Refer to the various `..._Visualized.md` documents for a more thorough understanding of specific engine systems.
3.  **Quick Reference:** Keep `UE4_Learning_Resources.md` handy for quick access to common C++ code patterns in UE4.
4.  **Check Your Knowledge:** Use the `UE4_Self_Check_Problems.md` to solidify your understanding.
5.  **Apply Concepts:** Explore the `UE_Project/` to see practical implementations of the concepts discussed.

## Bilingual Content

All core documents in this repository are maintained in both **English** and **Chinese (ZH)** to serve a wider audience.
